This module implements create and drop functions for databases.  It aims to
provide a common interface to database creation and deletion regardless
of the actual database being used.

Currently supported databases are MySQL and PostgreSQL.  Assistance adding
support for other databases is welcomed and relatively simple - see the
DBIx::Database::Driver documentation.

To install:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test # nothing substantial yet
	make install

Documentation will then be available via `man DBIx::Database' or
`perldoc DBIx::Database'.
